### Custom JFrame with Java Swing

#### Overview
This Java program demonstrates how to create a custom JFrame using Java Swing. The custom frame sets a title, defines a default close operation, prevents resizing, sets a custom icon, and specifies a background color for the content pane.

#### Components

- **MyFrame Class**
  - Extends `JFrame` to create a custom frame.
  - Sets the title of the frame to "Little Frame for xFraga".
  - Sets the default close operation to `EXIT_ON_CLOSE`.
  - Prevents the frame from being resized.
  - Sets the size of the frame to 720x720 pixels.
  - Makes the frame visible.
  - Sets a custom icon using `setIconImage`.
  - Sets the background color of the content pane to a dark shade (`#1c2b3a`).

- **Main Class**
  - Contains the `main` method to instantiate and display an instance of `MyFrame`.

#### Usage
To use this program:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the `MyFrame.java` and `Main.java` files.
   ```bash
   javac MyFrame.java Main.java
   ```
3. Run the `Main` class.
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
4. The custom frame titled "Little Frame for xFraga" will appear with the specified settings.

#### Notes
- The program assumes there's an `avatar.png` file in the current directory for setting the custom icon. Adjust the file path if necessary.
- Modify the title, size, icon, and background color to suit your application's requirements by editing the `MyFrame` class.
